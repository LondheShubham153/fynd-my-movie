<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great Movie CRUD APIs available on GitHub, however, I didn't copy from them, I created FynMyMovie which made me understand a new framework AIOHTTP. 

Here's why you should love this assignment:
* I am fluent in Django, Flask and python-cli applications, learning Aiohttp added a new feather to my cap of Python frameworks.
* Getting to know about async await was fun and insightful, this is the very first implementation of of the same.
* You will find good code quality and code standards which can be used to demonstrate to beginners, if not no issues as we are in an agile world. Learning continously:)


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This application is built with love, dedication, coffee and:
* [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/)
* [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
